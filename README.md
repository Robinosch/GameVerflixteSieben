# GameVerflixteSieben
A school project to create a game with a graphical user interface

How to play:

Dice so many times as you want!

The other player tries to get higher points than you 
with the same amount of attempts.

BUT if you dice a seven you end your turn automatically
and your points get subtracted by 7.

You can set the money u bet every round!

The Budget is always $1000!
